I remember spending hours tinkering with my first laptop, learning how to code, what does coding means, why are there different programming languages, and what does programming languages do. It wasn't long before I was hooked, and I started to explore the many different areas of computing, from programming languages to hardware and networking. Looking back, I'm grateful for those early days and the foundation they provided for my later studies and career in the tech industry</p>

By my third year, I decided to try my hand at freelancing to gain more experience, I created games, developed a mobile application, web based systems, and anything that is related on what I wanted to learn. I started small, taking on students as clients and using their projects as opportunities to improve my skills. As word of mouth spread, I began to receive offers for paid projects from other students.</p>

                <p class="timelineDesc">As I approached my fourth year of college, the demands of my coursework increased, I realized that I needed to focus on my thesis project and stop receiving offers from other students to do the work for them. It was a difficult decision, but I knew that my academic work had to come first. 
                    <br><br>
                Our hard work paid off, and our thesis project was selected for the best capstone competition at our school. Unfortunately we didn't managed to stay on the top and lost the competition. However, it was a tremendous honor, and I was thrilled to be recognized for our efforts. The experience of presenting our work to a panel of judges and competing against other top students was exhilarating, and it gave me a new appreciation for the value of academic research and collaboration.

                Despite the mixed emotions, I knew what I wanted for myself and my future. I had always dreamed of working in tech field, and I was determined to make that dream a reality. Within a few months of graduating, I landed my first job as an associate software engineer at Accenture. It was a big milestone for me - the first step on the road to achieving my goals in my career.

                Every day was a new challenge - the technologies I had never heard of before, the tools I had never used, and the concepts I had never encountered. It felt like I was back in my first year of college again, overwhelmed and unsure of how to proceed.

                But despite the steep learning curve, I was determined to succeed. I put in long hours of study and practice, determined to master the skills and technologies.
                    <br><br>
                As the bootcamp progressed, each challenges were more difficult than the last. I struggled at times, but I never gave up. And in the end, my hard work paid off - I passed all of the assessments, the frontend, backend, and DevOps assessments.
